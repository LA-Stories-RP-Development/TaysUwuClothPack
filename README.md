## Single Player 

- Copy the taysuwuclothpack folder found within the SINGLE PLAYER folder  with the dlc.rpf file to this sub folder of your mods folder: mods/update/x64/dlcpacks (Create it if its not there)

- In order to make the game load this new dlc.rpf file, we need to modify the games dlclist.xml, this can be done by searching for dlclist.xml using OpenIV and copying it to your mods folder: mods/update/update.rpf/common/data (Create it if its not there)

- Open the dlclist.xml and add the following:

```xml
<Item>dlcpacks:/taysuwuclothpack/</Item>
```

To apply the new clothes you will need some mod menu, suggested ones are:
Menyoo: [https://github.com/MAFINS/MenyooSP/releases](https://gta5-mods.com/scripts/menyoo-pc-sp)

--------------------------------------

## ALTV

Open the ALTV folder and add taysuwuclothpack to your server.cfg as a separate line below resources and before the enclosing. Your server.cfg resources configuration could look similar to this:

```
resources: [
  altv-better-clothing,
  taysuwuclothpack
]
```

Start your server and connect to it

--------------------------------------

## FiveM

- Download vMenu and put it in your server/resources folder [vMenu](https://github.com/TomGrobbe/vMenu/releases)

- Open the FIVEM folder and drag the tays_uwuclothpack inside the FIVEM folder, into your FiveM resources

- Add `ensure tays_uwuclothpack` to your server.cfg

- Press M to open vMenu  and browse thru your new added clothes (They are always added to the end / last DLC clothes)

## IF THEY DO NOT APPEAR, YOU DO NOT HAVE THE REQUIRED PATREON SUBSCRIPTION TO STREAM CLOTHING.
